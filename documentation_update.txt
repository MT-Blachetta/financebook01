Problem Identified and Fixed
The original error was:

ImportError: cannot import name 'Mapped' from 'sqlmodel'

txt


This was caused by outdated practices where the developers tried to use SQLAlchemy 2.0+ type annotations (Mapped) that weren't available in the SQLModel version being used.

Solution Implemented
Fixed Database Models: Completely rewrote app/models.py to remove problematic SQLModel relationship definitions while maintaining all essential functionality:

Removed incompatible Mapped type annotations
Simplified relationship definitions that were causing SQLAlchemy conflicts
Kept all core tables: PaymentItem, Category, CategoryType, Recipient, PaymentItemCategoryLink
Updated Dependencies: Updated requirements.txt with compatible version specifications for FastAPI, SQLModel, SQLAlchemy, and related packages.

Application Now Working
✅ Backend Server: Starts successfully without errors

✅ API Endpoints: All returning 200 OK instead of 500 errors:

GET /payment-items HTTP/1.1" 200 OK

GET /payment-items?expense_only=true HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
GET /payment-items?income_only=true HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
✅ Frontend: Loads successfully and displays the FinanceBook interface

✅ Navigation: All filters (All, Expenses, Incomes) work properly

✅ UI Components: Category filters, payment summaries, and navigation all functional
